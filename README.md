# govuk-government-organisations-autocomplete

This is an autocomplete for UK Government organisations.

The code is built on top of the [accessible-autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete) component, 
using data from both the [government-organisation register](https://government-organisation.register.gov.uk) and the 
(GOV.UK organisations API)[https://www.gov.uk/api/organisations]. This allows the autocomplete to be searched using 
previous names for organisations as well as abbreviations (eg 'DfE').
